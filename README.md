## Description 


For this project, I create the back end for an e-commerce website using Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.


## Usage 
This site is quite simple to use. From the command line, you can run MySQL and then seed the database. You will then be able to utilize the routes to fetch whatever information you desire in regard to sales.


## Learning Points 
I got to learn more on working with express, MySQL and Sequelize.
